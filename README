#Phylogeny of cytochrome p450 in fruit flies
There are toxin resistance among some of *Drosophila* species. This project has aim to build phylogeny tree of cytochrome p450 proteins for different fruit flies.

##Plan:
1.create project on github
2.download seqeunces from ncbi
3.create FASTA document
4.alignment via seqret
5.RAxML tree building
6.Vsualizing with Figtree
